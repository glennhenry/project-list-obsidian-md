**Description**: The first Jetpack Compose that I made myself without using tutorial. In this app I learned how to make different layout for different screen sizes. Page 1 and 2 is for compact screen size while 3 and 4 is for extended size.

**What I used** :
- ViewModel + UI State
- State Navigation
- [androidx.window.core.layout](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/window/core/layout/package-summary) packages

**What I did/made/learned** :
- Learned how to use ViewModel in Jetpack Compose and also use it to store UI State.
- Make uses of Compose state to change layout from list screen and detail screen.
- Made adaptive screen based on compact and extended screen sizes, although it failed on medium sizes.
