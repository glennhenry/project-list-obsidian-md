**Description**: After learning Jetpack Compose, I feel like making UI is easier compared to XML. I decided to remake my old [Webtoon Gacha](/android-development/android-xml/03-webtoon-gacha-2/webtoon-gacha-2) app. This app is much cleaner in terms of code and has better UI in my opinion compared to the old app.

**What I used** :
- Compose Material 3 Design + Theme Builder
- Room DB
- Material Search Bar
- Hilt for DI
---
**What I did/made/learned** :
- Learned more about UI designing in Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- Experimented with Gradle Build Types & Product Flavor for making different version of app
- Room DB CRUD Operation
- Learned how to use Material Search Bar and I also made a simple search history
- Improved the performance compared to old app by not querying to DB every time user get webtoon
  stats, filter specific category, or loading the list after navigating
