**Description**: A toy app made to explore basic use of Firebase API. Auth section will take email and password, check if it exists in Firebase else register new account. The Crashlytics and analytics is used to log crash and is not exposed to user, just to developer. The firestore has no real use, it simply takes collection and document name with some mockup data to add, read, or delete from Firebase.
