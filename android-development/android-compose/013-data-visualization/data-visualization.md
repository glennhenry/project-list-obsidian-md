**Description**: App made to apply Compose Canvas to real scenario and practice more about Jetpack Compose Animation. The line drawing animation is inspired from [Introduction to drawing in Compose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yiuxWK74vI&ab_channel=AndroidDevelopers)

Even though the name of this app is data visualization, the visualization is kinda broken as it doesn't show accurate representation of data.
