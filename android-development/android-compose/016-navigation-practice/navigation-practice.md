**Description**: A very simple toy app made to practice more about Jetpack Compose navigation.
Almost all stuff is hardcoded. The top bar shows backstack and below it there are text showing argument from screens.

---
**What I used** :
- Jetpack Compose Navigation
---
**What I did/made/learned** :
- Integrating bottom navigation with BackStackEntry
- Navigation argument by using route such as `route/{args}` with `listOf(navArgument)`
- Pass simple argument using SavedStateHandle args from ViewModel
- Navigating back with result using SavedStateHandle
- Nested navigation with shared ViewModel and shares data using shared state
- Navigation testing
