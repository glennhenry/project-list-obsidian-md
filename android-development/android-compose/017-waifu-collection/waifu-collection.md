**Description**: A list detail app made to learn about responsive screen. Waifu collection itself is just a random idea I had in mind. The layout is divided into 3, compact, medium, and extended and each layout has list / detail variation. I didn't use animation for medium layout animation for technical reason, I just couldn't think a way to do it.
