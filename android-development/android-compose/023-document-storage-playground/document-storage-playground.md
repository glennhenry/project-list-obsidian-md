**Description**: A project made to experiment various data, document, storage, and content API. The app itself demonstrate document picking, opening, and simple editing. I was trying to edit a PDF file, however, editing PDF file is more complex, as appending text directly may corrupt it. The UserDictionary also doesn't works, without any log errors.
