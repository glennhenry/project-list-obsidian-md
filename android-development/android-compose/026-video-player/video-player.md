**Description**: Third out of four project to learn about Media API in Android.
In this project, Im trying to learn about video playback using Android Media API, specifically ExoPlayer. Video playback and audio playback is quite same, therefore I copy pasted the UI design and most of the code from the previous project [Music Player](/android-development/android-compose/music-player). The only difference is
I didn't made the UI from scratch, instead I used the PlayerView UI. Handling player playback is much easier because most of the things are handled safely by the PlayerView.
