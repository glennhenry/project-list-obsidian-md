**Description**: The last project to learn about Media API in Android. It's a simple audio / video editor, it doesn't include alot of editing, because Media3 doesn't provide many editing API. Some of them are also too time consuming for me to learn and try. It only has trim for both audio and video and brightness effect as well as contrast effect for video.

This was made in rush, there are many bug and the project's code can still be improved. I also don't include the progress bar for the editing progress and always put the edited media output to Downloads folder.
