**Description**: The first project of the learning android's hardware series. Learned about camera API, specifically the CameraX. It was a simple camera consisting photo, record, and flashlight usecase which I can't test in emulator and webcam. There are other feature like camera switch and user experience feature to see recently photo or video taken.
