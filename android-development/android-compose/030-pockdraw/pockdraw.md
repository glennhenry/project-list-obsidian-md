**Description**: A simple canvas app made to learn about interaction in Android. Interactions includes touch, swipe, gesture, etc. However, the app doesn't really depend a lot on interaction, just gestures.

User gestures is captured and converted to a path. The path is then drawn on the screen and stored in some list. It supports undo and redo feature, however, the eraser doesn't work as expected. I'm not sure what is wrong, but I feel like finding the error will waste time, so I just skip it.
