**Description**: Last app to learn about networking related concept in Android (bluetooth chat app was a failure), this time it's about communication. This app make use of SMS and little telephony API in Android. It can fetch inbox and (but not outbox) message, although it still have some syncing issues. It can also make a simple call and add new contact using intent.
