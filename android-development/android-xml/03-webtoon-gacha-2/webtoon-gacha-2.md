**Description** : The addition I made for original [Webtoon Gacha I](/android-development/android-xml/01-webtoon-gacha-1/webtoon-gacha-1). This was the first project that get me out of tutorial hell.

**What I used** :
- RecyclerView (DiffCallback & ListAdapter)
- View Model + View Binding
- Room Database CRUD
- Hilt Dependency Injection
- Extra : (GET request to [Mangaupdates API](https://api.mangaupdates.com/) using Retrofit, API caching)
---
**What I did/made/learned** :
- Learned Room Database and CRUD operation
- Uses View Model for the first time to separate UI and business logic
- Learned how to use Hilt
- Made a simple GET request to API and cache it local database making it possible to see data without internet connection
