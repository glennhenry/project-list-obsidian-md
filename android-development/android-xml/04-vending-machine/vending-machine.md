**Description** : This project was created to replicate a simple Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture. It functions like a state machine, where each time the "Next" button is clicked, it is treated as an intent state. The state is then stored within the ViewModel and subsequently loaded into the View.

The vending machine is nothing related to the MVI, it's just thing that I have in mind while thinking about state machine.
