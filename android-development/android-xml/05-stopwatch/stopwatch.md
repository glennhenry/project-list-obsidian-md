**Description** : This project was created to replicate a simple Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture. This stopwatch app uses coroutine delay to make the timer, of course it won't be accurate but enough to simulate a stopwatch.

In the view, user input such as starting, stopping, or resuming stopwatch will be send to presenter. The presenter is view model and it will modify the model which is the stopwatch state. After updating model, presenter will update the view.
