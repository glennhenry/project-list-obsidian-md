**Description** : This project was created to replicate a simple Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.

User can interact with the date picker API, view model will observe everytime the date is changed and will update the text showing date below the date picker. After clicking pick date, view model will make a model and store it inside data store. Clicking load date will load the last stored date in the data store and view model will update the view.
