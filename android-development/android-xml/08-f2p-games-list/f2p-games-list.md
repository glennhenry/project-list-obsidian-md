**Description** : This project was created to replicate a simple Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) with clean architecture. This was the last XML project before I learned Jetpack Compose, the app itself is simple but I used almost all important thing I learned before.

Combining architecture stuff with clean architecture was indeed pain. After creating app 5 app with architecture, and I will never do it again. For a small app architecture feels like overkill even when attempting to replicate just the simple idea.
