**Description** : Trying to learn the practical side of computer graphics, more than just theory. It's not a rendering result, it's essentially just an image. All the code is from [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#dielectrics). Previously I learned about OpenGL without making projects, I thought this was gonna use OpenGL, but its not. So, I felt like I picked the wrong project, all of this is just copy pasting anyway.
