**Description** : Trying to make neural network from scratch by replicating fast.ai courses. Not fully from scratch, it uses library like pandas handling data numpy and pytorch for math, also only implemented architecture and forward pass, the backward pass used pytorch `backward()`.

The image above shows the loss and accuracy at the end. The actual implementation is a failure, not sure why, I followed the tutorial correctly but ended up with very low accuracy.
