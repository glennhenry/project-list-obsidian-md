**Description** : The fourth and the last tutorial project from [freeCodeCamp pytorch tutorial](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=fy7RMLXDo54P-PwU). It is an image classification model, architecture is replicated from [TinyVGG](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/). Trained on a custom food datasets (pizza, steak, sushi) from the Food101 Pytorch dataset. Starting from model 1 which doesn't use data augmentation and model 2 which uses the trivial wide augmentation. The accuracy of both model is bad, in real datasets, it is much harder to train model. Maybe it was because lack of data aswell, considering the training data for each class is just 75.
