**Description** : Again, nothing special, using library indeed makes life easier. Data used is also very simple, no need for a further data preprocessing and the data was perfect. Achieved accuracy 0.9+. Have harder time visualizing the data and decision tree instead of training the model.

What I used :
- Numpy
- Sklearn DecisionTreeClassifier, train_test_split, accuracy_score, load_iris()
---
What I did/made/learned :
- Learned more about matplotlib visualization
- Learned to use library for a simple machine learning problem
