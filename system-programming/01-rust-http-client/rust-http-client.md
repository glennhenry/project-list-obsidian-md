**Description**: First project about system programming, and the first real project for Rust. It's a CLI app that make HTTP request through the Rust raw TcpStream. It's not a fully functional HTTP client, in fact, it doesn't work. Probably the HTTP request I made doesn't follow the actual protocol, hence the server doesn't fulfill the request. Regardless of it's not working, I learnt many things about Rust.
